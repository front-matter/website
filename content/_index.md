# Software matters

Research software is recognised as [critical](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-024-00651-2) to research outcomes. As early as 2014, a [UK survey](10.5281/zenodo.14809) of 1,000 randomly chosen researchers showed that more than 90% of researchers acknowledged software as being important for their own research, and about 70% of researchers said that their research would not be possible without software.  A [study of Nature papers from Jan-March 2016]((https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2017.78)) reveals that “32 of the 40 papers examined mention software, and the 32 papers contain 211 mentions of distinct pieces of software, for an average of 6.5 mentions per paper.” [2].

Research software is also critical in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven research, and the technological infrastructure to support AI acceleration must include research software and its personnel. Read our [position paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13350747) on this vital part of AI infrastructure, which includes  recommendations for stakeholders on how to consider research software in their AI goals.
