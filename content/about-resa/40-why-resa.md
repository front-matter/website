[Software is pervasive in modern research](https://zenodo.org/record/3884311#.YeV3C1hBzJw), enabling the generation, analysis and/or presentation of research outputs. Research software is a key driver of innovation and the economy. ReSA focuses on software that is developed to serve a research purpose, rather than the standard software that some researchers also use for research purposes.

While software has started to be recognised internationally as a key part of facilitating trusted, reproducible research outputs and open science, recognition of research software as a valuable research input and output has lagged behind that of research data. AI-driven research is also [dependent on software](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13350747), although it is not always adequately understood that data preparation and model training are performed by software, and that models are implemented in software.

[Significant effort](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00651-2) is still needed to influence culture change towards research software across a broad spectrum of [stakeholders](https://www.researchsoft.org/stakeholders/), including researchers, institutions, funders, and publishers, and to develop and promote standards for developing research software that meets the needs of reliable, reproducible, and reusable research.
