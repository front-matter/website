## Introduction
The ReSA Task force on **“[Research institution policies to support research software](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/)”** aims to collect institutional policies for further dissemination as examples and encouragement to increase the value of research software assets worldwide.

For this task force, software policies, which can cover general software, open source software, and research software, refers to a set of guidelines, rules, and regulations established by an organisation around software or research software, meant to govern the creation, maintenance, acquisition, use, distribution and management of software within their environment, as well as to recognise such work. Software policies might cover multiple aspects of management to ensure legal, ethical, and secure use of software, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights, and can discuss how software work is used in hiring, evaluation, and promotion. 

Some common aspects covered by software policies include licensing, use and restrictions, credit, data privacy, software management, security, and intellectual property. In the case of open source software development, collaboration guidelines are of foremost importance. 

## Background
In the context of scientific research, research data management policies were implemented to encourage transparency, integrity, preservation, and to maximise the value of research data. Research software policies are closely interconnected and mutually supportive to research data management policies. Nonetheless, when research software is seen as not just another type of data, more intrinsic features of it can be addressed in its policy. Another motivation for institutions to develop and use these policies is compliance with funding agencies, government, and disciplinary requirements and norms around data and software management. Moreover, by establishing robust policies for research data and software management, institutions can promote good research practices, enhance collaboration, foster reproducibility, and maximise the value and impact of efficient and reliable scientific research.

## Collection
To date the ReSA collection on institutional policies to support research software has 28 policies. 

[The list is open for input of new policies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgXG1eSrby8e5wzqYOiOZW6KmJtR-wdBTrjr1_aMtF4/edit#gid=0), please add your institutional policy or contact us <info@researchsoft.org>. 

Many of the policies in this collection are focussed on research software. Some discuss open source software and a few are focussed on licensing software from a commercial perspective. There is also one example when research software is integrated into a Research Data Management Policy under the "Special Considerations for data" section, which includes software as a data type.

The second tab collects guidance on how to write a research software policy. 

## Invitation to join the task force
The ReSA task force on “[Research institution policies to support research software](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/)” was established early in 2023 with a few volunteers. The task force is open to stakeholders who want to join and help create a larger curated collection. The task force also intends to discuss requirements related to creating research software policy and possibly to share knowledge around how such policy has impacted their researchers’ recognition, their institutions, and the value of their research software assets. There are many other interests the task force can work on, and your ideas are welcome.
