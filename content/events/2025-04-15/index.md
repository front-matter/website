A committee has been established to implement the recommendations from ReSAâ€™s report, [_**Towards an International Research Software Conference**_](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14736835), aimed at fostering greater global engagement across the research software community. Among the key recommendations is the **first convening in 2026 of an annual international research software conference** to better engage change-makers, leaders and decision-makers from a range of stakeholder groups within the research software community, with equal representation of policy makers, national/international RSE associations, infrastructure providers, funders, university consortia, thematic communities (e.g. training), publishers, researchers on research software, etc. The inaugural international research software conference is expected to take place in the second half of 2026, alongside an existing event (yet to be determined).

**To subscribe to updates about the conference:** send an email to sympa@listserv.dfn.de and in the subject line of your message, type in: subscribe inrscon-updates@listserv.dfn.de Firstname Lastname.
