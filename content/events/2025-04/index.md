Join the Research Software Alliance (ReSA) for a hybrid half-day workshop designed for **funders and policymakers** who want to better understand research software and its role in research. This session will explain the critical importance of research software and its personnel to research impact, and the significant benefits of recognising this through funding programs and policy. 

The workshop will highlight ways in which stakeholders can support research software, both through dedicated programs and through research funding that includes indirect support. It will offer participants strategies on how to understand their organisationâ€™s existing funding investments in research software, and the extent to which existing policies that focus on research data management and/or open science may also support research software and its personnel. 

Participants will gain actionable insights on increasing recognition of research software, integrating it into funding initiatives, and making a case internally for its value within both specific and broader funding programs and policies. 

Funders and policymakers can [**register here**](https://forms.gle/vasS3ELYo9Et9ehn8).
