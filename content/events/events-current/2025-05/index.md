ReSA is excited to announce the launch of four new forums designed to foster global collaboration and accelerate progress in research software sustainability: 
- [**Metascience and Research Software (MaRS) Forum**](/forums/mars-forum/) brings together metascience groups, communities, and organizations to explore the impact of research software on the research ecosystem, especially its role in shaping the research process.
- [**Publishing Research Software (PubSoft) Forum**](/forums/pubsoft-forum/) is a collaboration of publishing organisations/initiatives that share academic research and scholarship. This includes both traditional publishers that publish text and/or software papers.
- [**Research Software Policy (RSP) Forum**](/forums/rsp-forum/) is a collaboration of policymakers—including representatives from organisations involved in research, open science, and open source software—who shape policy at national, regional, or international levels.
- [**Skills and Training for Research Software (STaRS) Forum**](/forums/stars-forum/) is a collaboration of skills and training organisations/initiatives that create curricula and learning pathways—primarily at international, national, or disciplinary levels—to support research software.

These forums provide a formal mechanism for members to share practices and consider how to individually and collectively address common challenges to achieve the significant cultural change needed across the research sector globally. 

Meetings are held every few months, with each session offered twice—12 hours apart—to accommodate participants across time zones.

**Get involved**

Each forum offers opportunities to engage with peers, share insights, and contribute to a coordinated global effort. If you're interested in participating in one of these forums, please contact [ReSA](mailto:info@researchsoft.org).
