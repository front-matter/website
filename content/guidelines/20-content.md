To help you identify key resources this page highlights those
relevant to each of the ReSA themes: people, policy and
infrastructure. These resources are mostly international
recommendations, reports and guidelines that emphasise best practice.

See also the **[ADORE.software Toolkit](https://adore.software/toolkit/)**. The toolkit provides examples of funder programs, policies, and resources for each of the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/)'s recommendations in the four areas of research software practice, research software ecosystem, research software personnel, and research software ethics.

### International policies

- OECD Council: In 2021 the OECD Council adopted a revised [Council Recommendation on Access to Research Data from Public Funding.](https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD-LEGAL-0347) This legal instrument was revised for the first time to include software, meaning that OECD members (which include most research-intensive countries) will have to create policy and law to implement it. This recommendation, which is known as a “soft law” legal instrument, has been updated to address new technologies and policy developments. It provides policy guidance in seven areas with an expanded scope to cover not only research data, but also related metadata as well as bespoke algorithms, workflows, models, and software (including code), which are essential for their interpretation. The OECD Council recommends fostering (and requiring where appropriate) the adoption of good practice for research data and software management across the research system, promoting data and software citation in academic practice (including the development of citation standards), training a cadre of research software engineers and enabling recognition and reward of software development skills as high value added to publicly funded research and innovation.

- UNESCO: The UNESCO [Recommendation on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) was unanimously adopted by member states in 2021. This recommendation defines open scientific knowledge as "open access to scientific publications, research data, metadata, open educational resources, software, and source code and hardware that are available in the public domain or under copyright and licensed under an open licence". In particular, the recommendation argues for users to gain free access to open source software and source code in a timely and user-friendly manner, in human- and machine-readable and modiﬁable format, under an open licence. The source code must be included in the software release and made available on openly accessible repositories, and the chosen licence must allow modiﬁcations, derivative works and sharing under equal or compatible open terms and conditions. See also the Checklist for Universities on Implementing the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science and other elements of the [UNESCO Open Science Toolkit](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/search/N-ff1a192d-dcf3-45b7-abb0-4f5dbed6b46e).

#### National and regional policies and strategies

-   Finland: [Policies of open science and research](https://avointiede.fi/en/policies/policies-open-science-and-research-finland) are being drafted for four areas: culture for open scholarship, open access to scholarly publications, open access of research data and methods, and open education and open access to educational resources.

Establishes a set of recommendations to allow the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) to include software, next to other research outputs like publications and data, in the realm of its research artifacts. This work is built upon a survey and documentation of a representative panel of current operational infrastructures across Europe, comparing their scopes and approaches. This report summarises the state of the art, identifies best practices, as well as open problems, and paves the way for federating the different approaches in view of supporting the software pillar of EOSC.
    
-    France: French [National Plan for Open Science](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/second-national-plan-for-open-science/), 2021.

- United Kingdom: The Government Office for Science’s report on [Large-scale computing: the case for greater UK coordination](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coordinating-the-uks-large-scale-computing-ecosystem) recognises that “high-quality software is fundamental to realising the benefits of investments in computing” and recommends “software development must keep pace with advances in hardware”. Recent reviews commissioned by individual research funders have echoed this including, BBSRC’s [Review of Data Intensive Bioscience](https://www.ukri.org/news/bbsrc-publishes-review-of-data-intensive-bioscience/).
