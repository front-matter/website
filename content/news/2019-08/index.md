This month, we have a call for community involvement in ReSA projects, along with some
timely tidbits from the larger community.

We also would like to acknowledge Scott Henwood’s contribution as a ReSA Steering
Committee member, as he steps down to focus on other things. We have greatly appreciated
having his expertise on the committee in the early stages of our formation.

ReSA’s [mission](http://www.researchsoft.org/) is to bring research software communities together to collaborate on the
advancement of research software, to achieve the [vision](http://www.researchsoft.org/) of research software being
recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide.
To deliver on this mission, we invite the ReSA community to begin collaborating on some
projects:

* Software landscape analysis. What are the different areas of the research software
community (e.g., preservation, RSEs, citation, productivity, sustainability)? This
understanding could be usefully written up into an article to educate the research
community about the importance of software, and/or used to identify if there are
representatives from each of these areas involved in ReSA. Please [contact ReSA](/contact) if you’re interested in collaborating on this.
* Evidence for the importance of research software. There’s the start of a list on [the ReSA website](http://www.researchsoft.org/resources/).
How can we add to this and make this information more widely utilised? Please [contact ReSA](/contact) if you’re interested in collaborating on this.
* Current opportunities for funding research software. A list of funding opportunities is
an example of a resource that ReSA can collectively build to help its constituent
members. How can we ensure this is presented in a useful way? How can we work
together to keep this up to date? Please [contact ReSA](/contact) if you’re interested in
collaborating on this.

The Steering Committee also hopes to have some good news on a small amount of funding
for ReSA to employ a community engagement manager in the near future, which will enable
some broader discussion on other initiatives that the community would like to initiate.
