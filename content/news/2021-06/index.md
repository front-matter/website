### FAIR4RS Update

The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group is now requesting community review of its first recommendation across the Research Software Alliance (ReSA), Research Data Alliance (RDA) and FORCE11 communities.

This recommendation is a document that presents the FAIR principles for Research Software. It is available for community input via [RDA](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg/outcomes/fair-principles-research-software-fair4rs). Your feedback on this document is the final step in finalising the principles. This review will remain open for the community to comment until 11 July 2021. Any further information will be sent via the FAIR4RS mailing list ([RDA FAIR4RS WG posts](https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/69317/posts)), which you are encouraged to join.

Did you know that the FAIR4RS WG has been presenting updates and hosting conversations three or more times per month every month in 2021? This is an amazing collaborative outcome involving the steering committee and the members of this community. A list of the events and the slides/videos is available in the FAIR4RS [engagements table](https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/blob/master/CommunityEngagement.md). This includes the recording from &quot;[Early outcomes of the FAIR for Research Software Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNRRGAUnVxw)" at RDA VP17. The FAIR4RS WG is organised by a Steering Committee of nine co-chairs: Michelle Barker, Paula Andrea Martinez, Leyla Garcia, Daniel S. Katz, Neil Chue Hong, Morane Gruenpeter, Fotis Psomopoulos, Jennifer Harrow and Carlos Martinez

**Upcoming FAIR4RS WG events include:**

### Research software community organisation profile: CodeMeta

This month we highlight the [CodeMeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) initiative, created in 2016. CodeMeta is both a scholarly metadata project and a vocabulary that defines and works with metadata that describes software. As a subset of the schema.org SoftwareSourceCode and SoftwareApplications classes, CodeMeta provides additional properties for research software. The [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group) has a CodeMeta task force, co-led by Martin Fenner from DataCite and Morane Gruenpeter from Software Heritage. The task force is working on an update of the CodeMeta schema to version 3.0, with the intent of aligning this schema with [schema.org](http://schema.org/) metadata.
