The[ Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/) (ReSA) [Steering Committee ](https://www.researchsoft.org/people/) is calling for nominations for additional members of the Steering Committee.

ReSA is interested in forming a more diverse Steering Committee and **nominations are encouraged from a broad range of ethnicities, genders, disciplines of study, geographies, career stages and backgrounds**. Nominated individuals are expected to have a broad understanding of, and a demonstrated commitment to research software or another relevant area, such as open science, open source software, open research infrastructure, open communities, community governance, etc.

Composition of the ReSA Steering Committee aims to reflect the global and diverse perspectives of the research software community, and the Steering Committee operates using inclusive participation practices. **ReSA is particularly seeking Steering Committee members who can support initiatives to increase global engagement**, including the opportunities identified by: the two new part-time ReSA Community Managers being located in Africa and Asia, [mapping] of the research software community in the Global South, and convening of the 2022 [Lorentz workshop](https://www.researchsoft.org/blog/2022-07/) on diversity, equity and inclusion in research software engineering.

The ReSA Steering Committee is responsible for ReSA’s [strategic direction](https://www.researchsoft.org/documents/Strategic_Plan_2021-23.pdf) and financial accountability. The role of the Steering Committee members is to provide strategic inputs to the development of ReSA, to achieve ReSA's vision that research software is recognised and valued as a fundamental and vital component of research worldwide, and ReSA's mission of bringing research software communities together to collaborate on the advancement of research software.

The **benefits of ReSA Steering Committee membership** include:

- Recognition as an international champion for research software and the people who develop and maintain it
- Broadening of networks with decision makers and key influencers
- Collaborations with the international research software community to solve common issues
- Learning and sharing of best practice

ReSA Steering Committee members are expected to commit to attend meetings in their time zone (i.e., at least every second meeting, as the meeting time alternates between two options), and to engage for a few hours a month in additional actions such as reviewing written materials or a more in-depth discussion online. The ReSA Steering Committee decides on the frequency and mechanisms for its meetings, which are currently monthly at times agreed to by the members. All ReSA events are held under the [ReSA Code of Conduct](https://www.researchsoft.org/code-of-conduct/). Legal responsibility for ReSA is held by ReSA’s fiscal sponsors, [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/).  

If you are interested in nominating yourself or someone else to be a ReSA Steering Committee member, then please

If you would like further information then please contact [Michelle Barker](michelle@researchsoft.org), Director, ReSA. The current Steering Committee will make decisions on membership and successful nominees will be contacted in April 2023.
