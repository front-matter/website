ReSA aims to coordinate discussions across a wide range of research software organisations and programs. Our stakeholders include funders, policy-makers, research software engineer associations, infrastructure providers, university consortia, publishers, and thematic communities.

ReSA is the secretariat for the [International Council of RSE Associations](https://researchsoftware.org/council.html) – we work with leaders in the research software engineering community through the Council. The following ReSA resources might be of interest to both leaders and individual RSEs:

- [Resources on how to create a research software engineering (RSE) group (within an organisation) or association (national, etc)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14025417): ReSA has collated existing advice, some of which are also collated in resources such as [RSE Groups in the UK; Origins, Organisational Context, and Practices \- ‘RSE Roadtrip’ Planning Document](https://zenodo.org/records/7852661#.ZFoEdexBwU6) by Kim Martin, [CommuneRS: A Community of Research Software Communities](https://github.com/EllaKaye/communers?tab=readme-ov-file) by Ella Kaye et al., [ADORE.software toolkit](https://adore.software/toolkit/) by ReSA, and [RSE Resources](https://us-rse.org/resources/rses/) by US-RSE. Contributions are welcome either as comments in the [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pQTBTApvwr0G61M1m8h4BypAorWFe6heiiZWwWk7ZY8/edit?tab=t.0) itself, or by emailing [info@researchsoft.org](mailto:info@researchsoft.org).
- Joint ReSA and Research Data Alliance Working Group on [Policies in Research Organisations for Research Software (PRO4RS)](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-resa-policies-research-organisations-research-software-pro4rs/forum/)  
- [Research Software Funding Opportunities Database](https://www.researchsoft.org/funding-opportunities/): ReSA has created this public database of current and past research software funding opportunities to improve the findability of this important information. Members of the community can add current funding opportunities via this [short form](https://forms.gle/r4Jw4swUd1SXigZc9).  
- [ADORE.software toolkit](https://adore.software/toolkit/): The toolkit aims to support implementation of the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/). It provides examples of funder programs, policies, and resources for each of the Declaration’s recommendations in the four areas of research software practice, research software ecosystem, research software personnel, and research software ethics.
- ReSA’s monthly [newsletters](https://www.researchsoft.org/news/) (subscribe [here](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/778129/110635094443558050/share)).
- [Research institutional policies to support research software](https://www.researchsoft.org/software-policies/) \- add your organisation’s policy to it [via this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenXMgY6c5IDpjvSxfXOWfMwvK8CNrWNFwqZNRgqqRYyyqVJg/viewform) or through a comment in the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YgXG1eSrby8e5wzqYOiOZW6KmJtR-wdBTrjr1_aMtF4/edit#gid=0).
