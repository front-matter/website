        ## ReSA Outputs

        ReSA outputs can provide useful references to support recognition and valuing of research software as a key component of research, and can also be found in the ReSA [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/resa/?page=1&size=20). See also the [**ADORE.software Toolkit**](https://adore.software/toolkit/). The toolkit is where ReSA amalgamates many resources. It provides examples of programs, policies, and resources for each of the [Amsterdam Declaration on Funding Research Software Sustainability](https://adore.software/declaration/)’s recommendations in the four areas of research software practice, research software ecosystem, research software personnel, and research software ethics.

        Recent outputs include:

        * [Research Software Funding Opportunities](https://www.researchsoft.org/funding-opportunities/) - updated regularly.

        ## Evidence for the importance of research software

        The significant role that software plays in research has been identified in a range of surveys and studies that include the following:

        * [Research Software - What to fund?](https://zenodo.org/records/10651247) summarises the results of an international survey that collected information from researchers worldwide on their expectations concerning an international funding call to support the development and enhancement of research software. The survey, conducted by the [Research Software Funders Forum](https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum/) working group on a multilateral funding call for research software, demonstrates a widespread interest in such an initiative and the areas in which such a call could be successful. 
        * [New data reveals the hidden impact of open source in science](https://medium.com/czi-technology/new-data-reveals-the-hidden-impact-of-open-source-in-science-11cc4a16fea2): The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has released a dataset entirely composed of 67 million software mentions mined from the scientific literature, to understand how widely research software and open source tools are used across disciplines.
        * [The role of software in science: a knowledge graph-based analysis of software mentions in PubMed Central](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.835) provides insights into the evolution of software usage and citation patterns across various fields, ranks of journals, and impact of publications.
        * [Charting the digital transformation of science: Findings from the 2018 OECD International Survey of Scientific Authors (ISSA2)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/charting-the-digital-transformation-of-science_1b06c47c-en) includes evidence that 25% of research produces new code.
        * [Software and skills for research computing in the UK](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10473186) reports that 97% of survey participants see software as important as their own research, with 85% citing it as essential.
        * [The Ecosystem of Technologies for Social Science Research](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/technologies-for-social-science-research) tracks increase in the use of software tools, along with characteristics of key tools. It is noted that whilst many commercial tools are available, the more innovative ones are coming out of academia.
        * [The top 100 papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/514550a) analyses the top 100 _Nature_ papers and finds that the vast majority describe experimental methods or software that have become essential in their fields.
        * [UK Research Software Survey](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14809) considers responses of 1,000 randomly chosen researchers to show that more than 90% of researchers acknowledged software as being important for their own research, and about 70% of researchers said that their research would not be possible without software.
        * [Understanding Software in Research: Initial Results from Examining Nature and a Call for Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06527) reveals that “32 of the 40 papers examined mention software, and the 32 papers contain 211 mentions of distinct software, for an average of 6.5 mentions per paper.”
