## Institutional research software policies ##

This collection highlights how research organisations govern the creation, maintenance, acquisition, use, distribution, management, and recognition of research software. Policies often address legal, ethical, and IP considerations, and may be part of broader open science or research data strategies. Institutions are encouraged to contribute their policies and engage with the [Policies in Research Organisations for Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/rda-resa-policies-research-organisations-research-software-pro4rs/forum/).

## National research software policies ##

The [Research Software Policy (RSP) Forum](https://www.researchsoft.org/rsp-forum/), convened by ReSA, curates national, regional, and international policies that support the development, recognition, and sustainability of research software. These resources are intended to guide governments and agencies in shaping or updating their policy frameworks.
