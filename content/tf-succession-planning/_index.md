        ### Overview


        ### [Succession Planning for Research Software](/tf-succession-planning/)

        The Succession Planning for Research Software Task Force aims to provide **a best practices guide** for responsibly wrapping up research code when individuals leave their institutions, addressing a common challenge faced across the international research software community. By gathering community feedback and creating an easy-to-use checklist, the group seeks to support sustainable transitions and long-term preservation of software projects. Outputs will include a GitHub repository or Jupyter Notebook and markdown-based checklists, all shared under a CC-BY 4.0 license.
